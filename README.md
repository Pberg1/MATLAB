# MATLAB
- A MATLAB connection to Yahoo Finance is necessary to fetch live prices.
- Alternatively, historical data can be imported manually by downloading it from the Yahoo website (e.g https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history?p=MSFT) and assigning the data to a variable ('s' is used here).
- The 'scrip.m' file combines the code form the individual files('MACD_1', 'RSI_1', 'BB_1', 'MOM_1', 'ST_1' and 'ATR_1') and plots the results in one file.
- 'TS.m' is not working at this time.
- Code comments are in German
